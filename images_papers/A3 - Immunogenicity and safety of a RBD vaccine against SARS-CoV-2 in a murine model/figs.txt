Fig. 1. A. BALB/c animal model experimental design. B. Kinetics and seropositivity of IgG-anti RBD in the assessed groups. A statistically significant difference in kinetics and seroconversion can be noted in BALB/C inoculated with two doses of the immunogen. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.0001, P1: one dose, P2: two doses.
